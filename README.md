## Overview

This repository contains code developed as part of a study project where the objective was to implement a TCP-like protocol for transmitting files to a remote client. The project focused on designing and implementing a reliable and efficient protocol for transferring files over a network connection, akin to the principles of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

## Project Features

- **Custom TCP-Like Protocol**: The code includes the implementation of a custom transport layer protocol that ensures reliable data transmission between a server and a client.
- **File Transfer**: The protocol allows for the transfer of files from the server to the client.
- **Reliability**: It incorporates mechanisms for error detection, acknowledgment, and retransmission to ensure data integrity and reliability during transmission.
- **Efficiency**: The protocol aims to be efficient in terms of bandwidth usage and data transfer speed while maintaining reliability.
